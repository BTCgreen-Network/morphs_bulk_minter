Chia NFT bulk minting tool
<br>
<br>
CAUTION: Use this with caution! This is an alpha build! You could ruin your NFT project if something goes wrong! I am not responsible for anything!<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
-Chia has to be installed in users home directory<br>
-Chia wallet has to be up and synced<br>
-You generated an NFT wallet already<br>
-Optional: You generated a did wallet<br>
<br>
You can only use nft.storage for now:<br>
-Image files must be named 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg...<br>
-Metadata files must be named 1.json 2.json 3.json...<br>
-You have to upload all Images in one go to get a single CID<br>
-You have to upload all Metadata files in one go to get a single CID<br>
-You have to upload all License in one go to get a single CID<br>
-Upload the files without folders!<br>
<br>
I recommend using NFT UP from nft.storage. It gives you the CID after upload and you just have to copy paste it in the config section<br>
<br>
You will only need the CIDÂ´s. Links will be generated automatically and hashes will be generated automatically<br>
<br>
If this tool was helping you, consider buying me a beer, or a beer factory, I am not your supervisor!<br>
